# TradeBot Project State

## Purpose And Authority

- Purpose: authoritative current-state summary for TradeBot.
- Authority level: current-state evidence below active approved plans and above the roadmap; the project workstream map is defined in `WORKSTREAM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and phase definitions and statuses are delegated to `ROADMAP.md`.
- Audience: operator, maintainers, Codex, contributors, reviewers, and handoff recipients.
- Last documentation/state audit: 2026-08-09 against Gate 5.1 branch
  `codex/gate5-completion-oauth-correlation` from merged base `75e35eda`.
- Last CMake/CTest verification evidence: 2026-08-09.

This document represents current state only. Historical execution belongs in Git commits, pull requests, issues, ADRs, and handoffs.

## Repository State

- Repository root: `/Users/vaheedgorgeen/TradeBot`.
- Branch, HEAD, and worktree values are runtime metadata. Inspect Git directly; historical snapshots are not current-state authority.
- The merged tree contains Phase 19 revalidation history, infrastructure validation, approved Workstream I artifacts, accepted ADR 0003, and the TradeBot skill-system expansion.
- Ignored artifacts observed: `build/`, `data/`, and `src/.DS_Store`.

## Current Roadmap State

`WORKSTREAM_ARCHITECTURE.md` defines the current Workstreams I-VII project map; `ROADMAP.md` is the deterministic phase authority. Current summary:

- Workstream I — Broker-Neutral Execution Foundation: Complete — Accepted through Phase 22.
- Workstream II — Broker Integration Program: FIBO Group through cTrader is the
  selected demo-only XAUUSD target. Official cTrader Open API is the sole
  integration path; Gate 1 and Gate 3 are revalidated, Gate 2 and Gate 5 were
  accepted by Wade on 2026-08-07. Gate 5.1 offline controls are
  implementation-complete awaiting Wade acceptance; provider OAuth
  verification and the Gate 6 umbrella (`Gate 6A → mandatory Wade checkpoint
  → Gate 6B`) are blocked.
- Workstreams III–VII: parallel/future domains unless separately activated.
- Phase 21: Complete — Approved; ADR 0003 is Accepted.
- Phase 22: Broker-Neutral Execution Adapter Alignment and MT5/Prop-Account Readiness; Complete — Accepted under `PLAN-20260624-workstream-i-broker-neutral-completion`.
- Phase 23: Complete — FIBO Group through cTrader selected by Wade.
- Phase 24: Gate 1 and Gate 3 are revalidated; Gate 2 and Gate 5 were accepted
  by Wade on 2026-08-07. Gate 5.1 local controls are implementation-complete
  awaiting Wade acceptance. Provider correlation verification, the Gate 6
  umbrella, market data, reconnect proof, and orders remain blocked.
- Phase 25: Not Started; no documentation platform is selected.
- Phase 26: Blocked pending Phase 25 selection and operator-approved documentation architecture.
- Live trading: disabled and unauthorized.

## Completed Work Verified In Current Tree

- C++20 core library and `tradebot_core` executable are configured in `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Tests exist for phases 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 22.
- Benchmarks exist for `throughput_bench`, `phase18_burnin`, and `apply_bbo_microbench`.
- Existing accepted ADRs:
  - ADR 0001: deprecate offline MOP/MOR/SS workflow.
  - ADR 0002: GitHub as long-term system of record after local cleanup is committed and pushed.
  - ADR 0003: Workstream I broker-neutral integration architecture.
  - ADR 0004: cTrader Open API is the sole integration path; implementation
    remains separately gated.
- Accepted Phase 22 broker-neutral implementation under `PLAN-20260624-workstream-i-broker-neutral-completion`; broker-dependent connectivity remains unauthorized.
- Runtime modes verified in `SystemConfig`: `BACKTEST`, `PAPER`, `LIVE`; default is `BACKTEST`.
- Credential loading verified through `AuthManager` and `SystemConfig` env names `AIIO_API_KEY` and `AIIO_API_SECRET`.

## In-Progress Work

- Repository governance and Codex skill-system maintenance.
- Gate 5.1 offline correlation implementation and review evidence under
  `PLAN-20260809-gate5-oauth-correlation-controls` and
  `CTRADER_OPEN_API_GATE5.md`. No OAuth or cTrader operation has executed.

## Blocked Or Constrained Work

- The cTrader Algo/cBot Bridge is
  `ABANDONED — NON-CONTROLLING — OUT OF SCOPE`; it is not an evidence source or
  fallback and is not to be investigated under Gate 5.
- OANDA is permanently cancelled.
- Provider OAuth verification, token exchange, cTrader endpoints, account discovery,
  XAUUSD metadata/quotes, reconnect proof, every order operation, live accounts,
  and live trading remain Blocked / NO-GO until exact later directives.
- Gates 1-3 now control protocol fit, numeric mapping, and pre-implementation
  baseline integrity. Generated C++ bindings and the selected toolchain are not
  installed or approved. Local Gate 5.1 controls are implemented, but OAuth
  `state` round-trip remains an unresolved provider question.
  Exact FIBO `brokerTitleShort` and intended demo-account identity must be
  observed in Gate 6A and confirmed by Wade before Gate 6B, not guessed or
  required before discovery. The spot timestamp unit remains later-gate
  evidence.
- Phase 26 is blocked until Phase 25 selects a documentation platform and the operator approves documentation architecture.
- GitHub-dependent sync remains constrained by intermittent or costly global connectivity.
- Ubuntu compute-node commands are not verified in this workspace.
- Markdown link-checking is unavailable locally because no link-check tool was found.
- Static-analysis and formatter commands are unconfigured locally.

## Known Defects And Warnings

- Previous full compile output emitted existing warnings:
  - `src/AsyncNetworkClient.cpp`: unused `SSL_ERROR_NONE`.
  - `src/RiskEngine.cpp`: `totalPositioned` set but not used.
- No failing tests were observed during local verification.
- `data/.DS_Store` and `src/.DS_Store` exist as ignored local artifacts.

## Documentation System Status

- Root `AGENTS.md`, `PLANS.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` are present locally.
- Dedicated testing, data, security, actor, workflow, handoff, benchmarking, dependency, configuration, style, failure-recovery, live-readiness, glossary, review, release, project workstream architecture, Workstream I, and Phase 22 offline-research documents are present locally.
- `CTRADER_OPEN_API_GATE1_PROTOCOL_FIT.md`,
  `CTRADER_OPEN_API_GATE2_NUMERIC_CONTRACT.md`,
  `CTRADER_OPEN_API_GATE3_BASELINE_INTEGRITY.md`,
  `CTRADER_OPEN_API_GATE5.md`, and ADR 0004 define the sole Open API protocol,
  numeric, baseline, OAuth, secret, account-ID, and demo-only boundary.
- `.agents/skills/` TradeBot skill files are present locally, including `tradebot-git-safety`.
- `WORKSTREAM_ARCHITECTURE.md` is the current project-level Workstreams I-VII map; `ROADMAP.md` is the canonical phase authority; this document summarizes current state.

## Verification Evidence

Verified locally on 2026-08-09:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R phase22_tests --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R '^ctrader_gate5_1_tests$' --output-on-failure
```

Results:

- Configure succeeded.
- Build succeeded.
- Full CTest suite passed: 7 tests, 0 failed.
- Targeted `ctrader_gate5_1_tests` passed.

## Operating Constraints

- Default operation remains offline-first and low-bandwidth-conscious.
- GitHub is the long-term system of record after local work is committed and pushed; inspect Git directly for current branch and commit state.
- External dependency downloads, web lookups, exchange checks, and remote API work should be grouped into planned connectivity windows.
- Live trading remains prohibited without explicit operator authorization and readiness evidence.

## Next Safe Action

Wade review of the Gate 5.1 offline implementation PR and transfer evidence is
the current bounded action. A later directive may authorize provider OAuth
correlation verification. The complete Gate 6 umbrella remains blocked; Gate
6A and Gate 6B require distinct later directives with a mandatory Wade
identity/account checkpoint between them.

## Next Professional Halting Point

Stop after the Gate 5.1 offline implementation review handoff. Do not execute
provider OAuth, token exchange, Gate 6A, Gate 6B, connectivity, account
requests, market data, reconnect testing, order operations, or live use
without a new directive.
